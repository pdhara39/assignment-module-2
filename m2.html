        Q.3  What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3?
        Ans.  CSS2 was comprised of a single document where CSS3 has its specifications divided into many individual modules, which makes 
        CSS3 a whole lot easier to handle. With CSS3, the designers can now use special fonts, like those available in Google Fonts and Typecast. 
        The CSS3 version supports more browsers than CSS2.CSS3 introduces several new selectors. Those new selectors square measure largely in an exceeding type of pseudo-elements and pseudo-categories.CSS3 introduces several properties attended with new values and units. It facilitates styling of backgrounds, borders, boxes, etcâ€¦

    <pre>
        Q.5  What do you understand by CSS opacity? 
        Ans. The opacity CSS property sets the opacity of an element. Opacity is the degree to which content behind an element is hidden, 
             and is the opposite of transparency.
            To change the opacity of a background only, use the background property with a color value that allows for an alpha channel. For example:
            background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
            0.4 is the value of opacity
    </pre>
    <pre>
        Q.6  How can the background color of an element be changed? 
        Ans. By giving value of color name to background-color property we can change background of particular element.
             for example:
             body {
                background-color: blue;
             }
    </pre>
    <pre>
        Q.5  How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?
        Ans. Image repetition of the backup be controlled by using background-size property.
             For Example:
             body{
                background-size: cover ;
             }
    </pre>
    <pre>
        Q.7  What is the use of the background-position property?
        Ans. The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image. By default, a background-image is placed at 
             the top-left corner of an element, and repeated both vertically and horizontally.
             For Example:
             background-position: center top;
    </pre>
    <pre>
        Q.8  Which property controls the image scroll in the background? 
        Ans. The background-attachment property sets whether a background image scrolls with the rest of the page, or is fixed.
             For Example:
             background-attachment: fixed;
    </pre>
    <pre>
        Q.9  Why should background and color be used as separate properties? 
        Ans. It enhances the legibility of style sheets. The background property is a complex property in CSS, and if it is combined with 
             color, the complexity will further increase.
    </pre>
    <pre>
        Q.10  How to center block elements using CSS1?
        Ans.  With css the way to center anything that's a block level element is with the margin property. One of the values of margin is
             auto and by setting auto on the left and right margin our block level element will center itself.
             for Example:
             element {
                width:500px;
                margin: auto;
            }
    </pre>
    <pre>
        Q.11  How to maintain the CSS specifications?
        Ans.  If there are two or more CSS rules that point to the same element, the selector with the highest specificity value will "win", 
              and its style declaration will be applied to that HTML element.
              Think of specificity as a score/rank that determines which style declaration is ultimately applied to an element.

        Q.12  What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page? 
        Ans. Three Ways to Insert CSS
            Inline CSS : it can be used in tag directly
            Example:
                    <pre> &lt;h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center;"&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;</pre>
            
            Internal CSS:An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.The internal style is
             defined inside the &lt;style&gt; element, inside the head section.
           
            External CSS:With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
                        Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside 
                        the head section.
           
    </pre>

    <pre>
        Q.13  What is embedded style sheets?
        Ans. Embedded Stylesheet: It allows you to define styles for a particular HTML document as a whole in one place. This is done by embedding
         the <style></style> tags containing the CSS properties in the head of your document. Embedded style sheets are particularly useful for 
         HTML documents that have unique style requirements from the rest of the documents in your project.
        Example:
        <p>
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
        &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
            &lt;style&gt;
                body {
                    background-color: linen;
                    }
                h1 {
                    color: maroon;
                    margin-left: 40px;
                   }
            &lt;/style&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1>This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p>This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
        &lt;/html&gt;
                </p>

    </pre>

    <pre>
        Q.14  What are the external style sheets?
        Ans. With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
        Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside 
        the head section.

        Example: 
        <p>  
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
        &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
        &lt;/html&gt;
    </p>
            <h3>css file with name style.css</h3>
    body {
        background-color: lightblue;
      }
      
      h1 {
        color: green;
        margin-left: 50px;
      }
    </pre>
    <pre>
        Q.15  What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?
        Ans. The benefits of using an external style sheet are:
            everything is stored within a single file.
            once changed/updated, the changes are reflected on all other pages that reference the stylesheet.
            this makes it easier to maintain larger websites.
            pages load quicker once the main CSS file has been cached.
        The disadvantages of external css is:
            Your pages may not be rendered correctly until the external CSS is loaded.
            Uploading or linking to multiple CSS files can increase your sites download time.
    </pre>
    <pre>
        Q.16  What is the meaning of the CSS selector? 
        Ans.  CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.
        We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
                Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
                Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
                Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
                Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
                Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
    </pre>
    <pre>
        Q.17  What are the media types allowed by CSS? 
       Ans.  Media types describe the general category of a device. Except when using the not or only logical operators, the media type is
             optional and the all type is implied.

            all: Suitable for all devices.
            print:Intended for paged material and documents viewed on a screen in print preview mode. 
            screen:Intended primarily for screens.
    </pre>
    <pre>
        Q.18  What is the rule set? 
        Ans. The CSS Ruleset is used to apply a set of properties with some define values for the element or a specific set of
         elements that are used in the HTML page.
